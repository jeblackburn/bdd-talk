    Given user TH8 logged in to orc
    When the user requests to add a new folder to their report library
    Then a folder is created and the folder's id is returned
	
	
    @When("the user requests to add a new folder to their report library")
    public void userRequests_toCreateANewFolder_inReportLibrary() throws Exception {

        when(mockCreateFolderRepository.createFolder(any(), any(), any(), any())).thenReturn(10031);

        OrcUser orcUser = new OrcUser();
        orcUser.setUserId(loggedInUserId);

        when(mockOrcUserRepository.getByUserId(loggedInUserId)).thenReturn(orcUser);
        response = mockMvc.perform(post("/v1/reportLibrary/createFolder")
            .content("{\n" +
                "  \"destinationId\": 10,\n" +
                "  \"folderName\": \"New Folder Name\"\n" +
                "}")
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
            .principal(mockOauth));
    }

    @Then("a folder is created and the folder's id is returned")
    public void theNewFolder_isCreated_AndNodeSk_isReturned() throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        MvcResult mvcResult = response.andReturn();
        assertThat(mvcResult.getResponse().getStatus()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK.value());
        assertThat(mvcResult.getResponse().getContentAsString()).contains("10031");
    }

    Given user TH8 logged in to orc
    And the user does not have permission to create folders
    When the user requests to add a new folder to their report library
    Then the folder is not created and an error is returned
